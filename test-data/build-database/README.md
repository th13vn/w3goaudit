# Database Building Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite validates the W3GoAudit database builder with focused, simple test contracts.

## Test Files

### 01-basic-contracts.sol
**Purpose:** Test basic contract types and function visibility

**Tests:**
- Interface detection (`IToken`)
- Library detection (`MathLib`)
- Abstract contract detection (`Ownable`)
- Main contract detection (`BasicToken`)
- Function visibility: `external`, `public`, `internal`, `private`
- Function types: `view`, `pure`, regular
- Entry point identification (public/external functions)

**Expected Results:**
- 1 Interface, 1 Library, 1 Abstract, 1 Main Contract
- BasicToken has 4 entry points: `mint()`, `transfer()`, `balanceOf()`, `calculate()`

---

### 02-inheritance.sol
**Purpose:** Test inheritance and C3 linearization

**Tests:**
- Multiple inheritance (`MyToken` inherits from `Pausable` and `Ownable`)
- Diamond pattern (both inherit from `Context`)
- Interface implementation
- C3 linearization order

**Expected Results:**
- Main Contract: `MyToken`
- Linearized bases: `MyToken -> Pausable -> Ownable -> Context -> IERC20 -> IOwnable`
- Entry points: `totalSupply()`, `mint()`, `pause()`, `unpause()`

---

### 03-function-calls.sol
**Purpose:** Test call graph building

**Tests:**
- Internal function calls
- External calls via interface
- Library calls
- Low-level calls (`.call`, `.delegatecall`, `.staticcall`)
- Self-calls (`this.function()`)
- Payable functions

**Expected Results:**
- Call graph tracks all call types
- `processDeposit()` -> `_validateAmount()`, `_transferToVault()`, `_updateState()`
- Library calls to `MathLib.add()`
- External calls to `IVault.deposit()`

---

### 04-complex-types.sol
**Purpose:** Test function signature generation with complex types

**Tests:**
- Simple types (address, uint256, bool)
- Arrays (dynamic and fixed-size)
- Structs (simple and nested)
- Mappings
- Tuple returns
- Bytes types

**Expected Results:**
- Accurate signatures for all parameter combinations
- Struct types properly resolved
- Array dimensions preserved
- Named returns captured

---

### 05-state-modifiers.sol
**Purpose:** Test state mutability and modifiers

**Tests:**
- State mutability: default, `view`, `pure`, `payable`
- Custom modifiers: `onlyOwner`, `nonReentrant`, `validAmount`
- Multiple modifiers on single function
- Virtual and override functions

**Expected Results:**
- Correct mutability classification
- Modifier names captured
- Virtual/override flags set
- Inherited functions tracked

---

### 06-extract-involve.sol
**Purpose:** Fixture for the `extract involve` / `extract inheritance` subcommands

**Tests:**
- Transitive workflow discovery from an internal helper to its entrypoints
- `extract inheritance` accepting a main contract and rejecting a library
- Library calls preserved across an `abstract → concrete` inheritance chain

**Contract shape:**
- `Math` (library) — `clamp(v, max)`
- `VaultBase` (abstract) — `_clamp(v)` calls `Math.clamp`
- `VaultV1` (main, inherits `VaultBase`) — entries `deposit()` and `withdraw()` both call `_settle()`, which calls `_clamp()`

**Expected Results:**
- `extract involve _settle` → 2 workflows (`deposit`, `withdraw`)
- `extract involve _clamp` → 2 workflows (transitively, via `_settle`)
- `extract inheritance VaultV1` → succeeds
- `extract inheritance Math` → fails (library, not deployable)

## Running Tests

### Build Database
```bash
./w3goaudit build test-data/build-database/ -o test-db.json
```

### Verify Results
```bash
# Check statistics
cat test-db.json | jq '.mainContracts | length'  # Should be 5-6

# Check contract types
cat test-db.json | jq '.contracts | to_entries[] | select(.value.kind == "interface") | .key'

# Check entry functions
cat test-db.json | jq '.contracts["path#ContractName"].functions[] | select(.visibility == "external" or .visibility == "public") | .name'
```

### Generate Summary
```bash
./w3goaudit test-data/build-database/ --md -o build-test-summary.md
```
